# LLM Pseudocode Specification v1.0

This repository contains the "LLM Pseudocode Spec v1.0," a specification designed for writing pseudocode optimized for use with Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Contents

- `LLM_Pseudocode_Spec_V1.0_JA.txt`: Specification in Japanese
- `LLM_Pseudocode_Spec_V1.0_EN.txt`: Specification in English
- `original/LLM_Pseudocode_Spec_V1.0_JA.txt`: Original Japanese specification (for reference)

## Overview

This specification defines a pseudocode format designed for easy interpretation, generation, and understanding by AI. It introduces explicit structures for meta-information, block constructs, and semantic linking to reduce ambiguity and enhance clarity.

## Intended Use Cases

- Code generation and analysis tasks optimized for LLMs
- Standardizing input formats for model training and testing
- Designing pseudocode that preserves and strengthens semantic structure
